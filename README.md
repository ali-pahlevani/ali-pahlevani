# Bio (Ali Pahlevani)
Over the past few years, I have focused on improving the observability of the heading angle in quadrotors within GPS-denied environments through my MS thesis, using the MSCKF method as the base VIO algorithm. During this time, I gained hands-on experience with drones and VIO modules, developing a VIO system with Jetson Nano, the IMX219 stereo camera, and other hardware for VIO and SLAM tasks.
Currently, I am concentrating on SLAM and Sensor Fusion for AMRs, particularly in indoor, dynamic environments. I focus on fusing Visual, LiDAR, IMU, and Encoder data to enhance Localization and Mapping, while reducing system Covariance through AI-driven methods. This work is deepening my expertise in ROS2, Gazebo, C++, and Linux. Applying algorithms and coding to real-world projects is incredibly satisfying.
I have a passion for Optimization Algorithms, particularly Heuristics, which Iâ€™ve successfully applied to control, filtering, navigation, and planning in both aerial and ground vehicles. Iâ€™ve also implemented control strategies like sliding mode control (SMC) and model predictive control (MPC), and gained experience with machine learning algorithms in both theory and practice.
As I prepare to begin my Ph.D., I am eager to broaden my research and contribute to advancements in autonomous systems.
